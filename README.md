# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

To learn more about developing your project with Expo, look at the following resources:

- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.

## Running on Expo Go from WSL2 (Android/iOS)

If you're running the dev server inside WSL2 and Expo Go on a phone, prefer the tunnel mode:

- Tunnel (most reliable across NAT/VPN):

   ```bash
   npm run start:tunnel
   ```

- LAN (same Wiâ€‘Fi, set your Windows host IP):

   ```bash
   export REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.x.x
   npm run start:lan
   ```

- Localhost + USB (Android):

   ```bash
   npm run start:localhost
   adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
   ```

Troubleshooting: keep Expo Go updated, ensure phone and PC are on the same network (for LAN), and clear cache if needed:

```bash
npm run start:clear
```
